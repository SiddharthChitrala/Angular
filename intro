Angular intro:

What is angular js?

Angular is an open-source front-end framework build using the js.

A client-side framework.

Developed and being maintained by Google.

It is an excellent framework for building single-phase app and line of business applications.

Angular js uses MVC architecture to develop web apps. It has two parts, Model View Controller.

Why Angular js?

Dependency injection: Dependency injection specifies a design pattern in which components Are given their dependency instead of hard coding them within the component.

Two-way data binding: Angular JS creates a two-way data binding between the selected element and the order prop model.Order props is then used as input of order by filter.

Testing: Angular JS is designed in a way that we can test right from the start. So, it is very easy to test any of its components through unit testing and end to end testing.

Model view controller: In Angular js, It is very easy to develop application in a clean MVC way.You just have to split your application code into MVC components i.e Model view and the controller.

Directors, filters, modules, routes etc...


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> MVC architecture <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

MVC stands for Model View Control. This is a software design pattern for developing the Web applications.

It is very popular because It isolates the application logic from the user interface layer and supports separation of concerns.

Uh model view controller pattern is made up of following three parts --

Model:
The data that we want our application to work with goes here in this part. In other words It is the lowest Level of pattern responsible for Maintaining data.

View :
It is responsible for Displaying all or A portion of the data to the user.

Controller :
This part interacts with both models as well as views.In other words ,It is a software code that controls the interaction between the model and the view.

        Event
          |
          |
      controller
          |
          |
         View
         |  |
         |  |
         model

The main purpose of this pattern is that it separates application logic from presentation layer..

>>>>>>>>>>>>Angular JS directives

Angular js facilitates you to extend HTML with new attributes.
These attributes are called directives.

This is a set of Built in directive in Angular js, which offers functionality to your application. You can also define your own directives.

Directors are special attributes Starting with ng - prefix.
Following are the most common directives :

ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch, ngClass etc...

*ng-app :These directors starts the Angular JS application.

*ng-init :This directive initializes application data.

*ng-model :This directive defends the model that is variable to be used in Angular JS

*ng-repeat :
This directive repeats a block of code for each element present inside an array or object.In other words, this directive repeats html elements for each item in a collection.
